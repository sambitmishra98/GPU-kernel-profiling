# Kernel profiling on NVIDIA H100 and Intel MAX 1100 GPUs

This repository contains the procedure to obtain performance of PyFR simulations subjected to a user-set list of GiMMiK kernels, followed by obtaining the roofline for the kernels using vendor-provided profilers.

Results/Intel/profiler contains snapshots and data files from the Intel V-Tune profiler applied on the Intel MAX 1100 GPU. The two GPUs were directly connected to the motherboard via a Gen 5 PCIe slot.
